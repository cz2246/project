Cem Zorlular - cz2246

Working authorization app with its separate server implementation to test along with a webpage.

It has three hard-coded accounts for testing:

Username: Cem Password: Cem

Username: Jane Password: Jane
Username: John Password: John

To test, simply run the server and go to localhost:3030 on your web browser

In the implementation, I worked closely with Pluralsight tutorial.
